The AI engineer's work, spanning from initial setup to the current state, has significantly evolved the Brothers of the Highway Member Management application. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes, including stabilizing  for Discord notifications, resolving complex deployment failures stemming from  due to missing email fields, and enhancing core functionalities like admin permissions, member privacy, and password changes. A major architectural shift occurred during this trajectory, moving the CSV export functionality from a problematic  in a new window to a dedicated React page (), resolving persistent browser security and script execution issues. This enabled the successful implementation of customizable print options with quarterly presets for dues and meetings, including dynamic print headers. Subsequent efforts concentrated on comprehensive responsive design across all major screens, ensuring a consistent white text theme, and adding critical features like archived member/prospect deletion, both of which were thoroughly backend and frontend tested. The current task is to address text color issues for system users based on recent user feedback.

The Brothers of the Highway Member Management application is a robust, role-based system for managing members and prospects. It includes secure login (v2.3), user and invite management (with Chapter, Title, Email). Key features involve secure data management with encryption, permission-aware CSV export. The CSV export now boasts a dedicated View Export React page, improved formatting, UTF-8 BOM, direct Google Sheets integration, and highly customizable print options (v2.3). Customizable print features now include quarterly presets for dues and meetings, with printouts displaying the selected quarter, CST date/time, and the user who generated the report. Member phone and address privacy is reinstated, visible only to National Chapter admins. An event calendar with fixed Discord notifications (v2.2) is integrated. The application adheres to a Professional Corporate look, responsive design across all screens (including CSV viewer, login, dashboard, user management, archived records), a dark theme, an in-app change log (v2.3), and a responsive AI chatbot. Password change functionality is fixed (v2.2). Additionally, archived members and prospects now have a delete option, and the CSV export is confirmed to show decrypted data.

-   Thoroughly test the new 3-role system (Admin, Member, Prospect) end-to-end, especially Prospect access restrictions.
-   Conduct end-to-end testing for the bulk promotion functionality.
-   Re-evaluate and fix the deployment issue, specifically the Kaniko build failure that reappeared (original issue, not fully re-addressed in this trajectory).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer received a user request: Text form system users needs to be white. This followed extensive work on responsive design for various screens (CSV export, archived members/prospects), ensuring all member and user-related text was white, and adding a back button to the archived members screen. The AI engineer has acknowledged this new request and has explicitly stated the intention to investigate the uploaded screenshot (from the user) and fix the text colors specifically within the System Users table. This indicates the current focus is on a specific UI/UX refinement concerning text color consistency for system users. The  file is a likely candidate for modification related to system user display.

<optional_next_step>
Check the screenshot for specific areas where system user text is not white, and then modify  to apply  where necessary.
